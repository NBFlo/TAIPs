# TAIPs

Transaction Authorization Improvement Proposals (TAIPs) provide standards for the [Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP)](https://tap.rsvp).

> [TAP](https://tap.rsvp) is a decentralized protocol allowing multiple participants in real-world transactions to identify each other and collaborate with the goal of authorizing them safely.

The purpose of TAIPs is to provide the community with a means to propose enhancements to [TAP](https://tap.rsvp) extending it's capabilities to unique transaction scenarios.

## TAIP Statuses
